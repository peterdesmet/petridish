The source file for this page is [`pages/docs/markdown.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterdesmet/petridish/main/pages/docs/markdown.md). There you can see the raw Markdown.

## Styling content

Petridish uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) as Markdown processor. This processor allows you to add attributes, such as CSS classes to your content (see this [blog post](https://digitaldrummerj.me/styling-jekyll-markdown/)). By sticking to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/) classes, you can easily style your content. If that doesn't fit your needs, you can always write html in your Markdown.

For example, the paragraph at the top of this page is styled as a [Bootstrap alert](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/alerts/) because it has `{:.alert .alert-warning}` on the line directly above it. This is how block elements like paragraphs can be styled.

Inline elements on the other hand, need a class right after it. For example, to style a link as a button, use `[Don't click](http://example.com){:.btn .btn-danger}`:

[Don't click](http://example.com){:.btn .btn-danger}

Note that kramdown does not process bare URL like GitHub does (they need to be written as `<url>`). If you want your content to [match the results you see on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) without the option to style, change the markdown parser in `_config.yml` to:

```yml
markdown: gfm # GitHub Flavoured Markdown
```

## Headings

## Table of content

Add `toc: true` to your page/post front matter. See [configuration]({{ '/docs/configuration/' | relative_url }}#pages).

## Paragraphs

## Line breaks

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

## Emphasis

This is **bold text**

## Lists

Unordered list:

## Code

Inline `code`

Code block by indenting code with 4 spaces:

    part_of_team = True
    if part_of_team:
      print("Everything is awesome!") # If you're part of a team

Code block by fencing code in backticks. This method allows supports syntax highlighting by adding the language, e.g. <code>```python</code>:

```python
part_of_team = True
if part_of_team:
  print("Everything is awesome!") # If you're part of a team
```

## Links

[link with url](http://www.example.com)

[link with title](http://www.example.com "title text")

[1]: http://www.example.com

[link with reference][1]

url: <http://www.example.com>

See the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#link) to create internal links. There are several approaches, but in my opinion the safest option is using root-relative permalinks (starting with `/`) and the `relative_url` filter:

- For pages: [{% raw %}`[link text]({{ '/about/' | relative_url }})`{% endraw %}]({{ '/about/' | relative_url }})
- For posts: [{% raw %}`[link text]({{ '/permalink_of_post/' | relative_url }})`{% endraw %}]({{ '/blog/2019/welcome-to-jekyll/' | relative_url }})
- For images and documents: [{% raw %}`[link text]({{ '/assets/images/name-of-image.jpg' | relative_url }})`{% endraw %}]({{ '/assets/theme/images/chuttersnap-146799-unsplash.jpg' | relative_url }})

You can simplify links if your site lives at a custom root domain (e.g. `https://example.com`, no `baseurl` set in `_config.yml`) or when Jekyll 4.0+ is used. Neither are the case for a default GitHub Pages, so the links below are likely broken:

- For pages: [`[link text](/about/)`](/about/)
- For posts: [`[link text](/permalink_of_post/)`](/blog/2019/welcome-to-jekyll/)
- For images and documents: [`[link text](/assets/images/name-of-image.jpg)`]('/assets/theme/images/chuttersnap-146799-unsplash.jpg)

If you want links that work on your site _and_ in your GitHub repository, use relative links to the Markdown files (e.g. `[about]{% raw %}(../about.md){% endraw %}`). These are automatically converted to permalinks by the [jekyll-relative-links](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links) plugin (enabled by default on GitHub Pages), but will break if you move pages around.

## Tables

Header 1 | Header 2
--- | ---
Row 1 col 1 | Row 1 col 2
Row 2 col 1 | Row 2 col 2 very_long_word_that_does_not_wrap_but_should_trigger_horizontal_scroll

Aligned columns:

Center aligned | Right aligned
:---: | :---
Row 1 col 1 | Row 1 col 2
Row 2 col 1 | Row 2 col 2 very_long_word_that_does_not_wrap_but_should_trigger_horizontal_scroll

HTML table with Bootstrap classes:

<table class="table table-dark table-striped">
  <thead>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Row 1 col 1</td><td>Row 1 col 2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Row 2 col 1</td><td>Row 2 col 2 very_long_word_that_does_not_wrap_but_should_trigger_horizontal_scroll</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Petridish will automatically wrap tables in a div with class [`table-responsive`](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/tables/#responsive-tables) to avoid tables getting wider than their parent container. It will also automatically convert `<table>` to `<table class="table">` to enable Bootstrap layout, unless you already defined class(es) for your table.

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

## Images

![alt text](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486825586573-7131f7991bdd?w=1000&h=200&fit=crop)
_You can add an image caption by including an `_emphasized sentence_` directly below the image without inserting a new line. This will wrap both image and caption in a paragraph._

See the [the links section](#links) to learn how to reference your own images and documents.

By default, images will be centered horizontally and use the full width if they can. But you can change **image alignment** by using [Bootstrap classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/content/images/#aligning-images).

For example, the image below is wrapped in a paragraph with `{:.col-md-8 .mx-auto}` to contain it (and its caption) to 8/12 of the width on medium and larger screens. On small screens the full width will be used. Controlling the width of an image is especially useful for portrait images.

{:.col-md-8 .mx-auto}
![alt text](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486825586573-7131f7991bdd?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1000&q=80)
_Image caption for this image should nicely wrap to the width of the container._

{:.clearfix}
![alt text](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486825586573-7131f7991bdd?w=150&h=150&fit=crop){:.rounded .float-start} The image to the left is styled with `{:.rounded .float-start}` to give it round corners and position it at the start (i.e. left), with text wrapping around it. Note that in [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/migration/#utilities) `.float-left` was renamed to `.float-start` and `.float-right` to `.float-end`, but the old class names are still supported in Petridish.

The image does not wrap around this paragraph, because the previous paragraph also has a [`{:.clearfix}`](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/helpers/clearfix/) class, which contains wrapping to that paragraph only.
